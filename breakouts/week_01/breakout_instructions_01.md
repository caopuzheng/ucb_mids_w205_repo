# Instructions for Breakouts for Week 01

Several breakouts are provided each week. Generally there won't be time to get to all of them. Instructors will select which ones and in what order they would like to use for their class each week. Instructors may choose to do some breakouts at the whole class level instead of using breakout rooms. For breakouts that we don't get to in class, that you are interested in, you can always come to office hours and discuss with the instructor or TA.

## Breakout 1 - Frustration in learning

In the Asynch, we talked about how learing how to learn is the best skill to have.  

In IT, we constantly have to learn new technologies to keep up.  This is especially true in Data Science and Data Engineering.  New technologies are constantly emerging.  So, it's crucial that we learn how to learn.

We also covered how a lot of students have an aversion to frustration in learning, and always see it as a bad thing. 

Think back to a time when you experienced frustration in learing a new, difficult topic.  Then after struggling with frustration, it suddenly clicked, and you got it!
* If you had limited yourself to what is easy to learn would you have ever learned this topic?
* Were you stretching yourself out of your comfort zone?
* Were you learning at your maximum potential?
* Did struggling with frustration and successfully resolving that frustration cause you to gain a much deeper understanding of the topic than if you had not struggled?

Each student in the breakout should share try to share one experience with the breakout group.


## Breakout 2 - You don't have to know everything about a technology to effectively use it

While it's great to know as much as we can about a technology, you don't have to know everything about a technology to effectively use it.  In the Data Science and Data Engineering world, by the time you learn everything about a technology, the next big thing has often come, and you now know everything about something that is obsolete.  

It's often best to learn a lot about the fundamental, foundational concepts of a subject matter, and then learn how those concepts apply to a latest software tools that are currently popular.

To demonstrate this point, each student should try a simple exercise.  Assuming everyone uses MS Word, probably on a daily basis (or MS Excel or MS PowerPoint or etc.) Flip though the tabs and estimate what percentage of features you have ever used.  Most will find that they have effectively used the software product on a daily basis for years, yet probably haven't used 10% of the features!

## Breakout 3 - New technologies tend to come in phases

For example, let's consider the case of machine learning (ML).  When companies first started having data science groups and hiring data scientists, it wasn't a requirement that a data scientist know ML, it was more of a nice to have.  ML books where all heavy duty mathematics, written by PhD's for PhD's.  Eventually ML became more  assessible with books making the material available to non-PhDs.  Companies started asking for ML knowledge.  Today, it's typically a requirement that a data scientist know ML to get a job.

Another example is massively parallel processing (MPP) using technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, etc.  At first MPP was the domain of advanced computer scientists.  Like ML, MPP was at first advanced, with difficult books, and companies didn't expect a data scientist to be able to do MPP, it was a nice to have.  As time has passed, MPP books got easier and more accessible to mainstream data scientists.  Today, while it's not a requirement that a data scientist know MPP, more and more jobs are asking for it.

Looking to the future, one possiblity for the next big thing is quantum machine learning (QML), in which quantum computers (QCs) are used to speed up parts of ML, deep learning (DL), etc. algorithms.  At present, we are still in the phase of books by PhDs for PhDs, with more accessible books just now starting to come out.

As a group, come up with the the risks, rewards, and expected frustration level of getting into a bleeding edge technology:
* At the beginning, it's being used by less than 1% of data science shops.
* At the midpoint, it's being used by 50% of data science shops.
* After it has gone mainstream, when it's being used by almost all data science shops.

## Breakout 4 - Data scientists working with data engineers

In this scenario, the company has 2 separate groups with 2 separate managers:
* Data Scientists
* Date Engineers

Bob is a newly hired data scientist with no data engineering skills.  Whenever he needs data engineering work, he has to have someone from the data engineering team do it for him. 

There is an old funny saying: "Some people always think something they cannot do must be easy."  Bob is one of those people.  He thinks data engineering is easy, even though he can't do it himself.  

Alice is a well respected data engineer. She gets assigned to help Bob.

Bob gives Alice information about a dataset that he needs a data pipeline built for "ASAP!!!" in his words.  Bob demands that Alice give him an immediate estimate.  Alice says she needs to at least take a look at it before giving an estimate.  A couple of hours later Alice tells Bob 2 or 3 weeks and gives the areas that are questionable that might take longer. 

Bob blows up and says it should only take 1 week, and Alice is milking it out to 2 or 3 weeks.  

Alice starts working on the pipeline, but hits a glitch at the end of week 1.  She immediately alerts Bob and explains the situation.  Alice is very professional in handling the situation, but Bob blows up even more.  He sends out emails to his manager and Alice's manager telling a version of the story that is misleading.  Bob also criticizes Alice in front of the business side telling them that he would have their solution a lot sooner but data engineering is working really slow and holding up their solution.

Alice finishes the pipeline in 4 weeks.  It's excellent work, however Bob gives Alice no credit and instead unjustly accuses Alice of milking a 1 week task for 4 weeks.

Word spreads quickly of how Bob treats data engineers.  No data engineer wants to work with him.  When their manager asks them to work with Bob, they always ask if they can have something else.  The manager ends up assigning the more junior data engineers to Bob, as she's afraid her best data engineers will leave if they have to work with Bob.  The junior data engineers are warned to triple estimates for Bob.  If something takes 3 weeks, give an estimage of 9 weeks.  Bob will accuse them of milking no matter what they do.

As a team come up with a list of lessons learned from this scenario:
* What is Bob's most egregious action?
* Specific to Bob, what should the data science manager do at this point?
* Specific to Bob, what should the data engineering manager do at this point?
* In general, not specific to Bob, what should the data science manager do at this point to build a better working relationship with data engineering?
* In general, not specific to Bob, what should the data engineering manager do at this point to build a better working relationship with data science?

## Breakout 5 - Hiring the right mix of skills for a startup data science team

In this scenario, your breakout team is a team of temporary contract data scientists at a startup company that is building a data science team from the ground up.  You have been hired for 3 months to hire and assemble a core data science team of 3.

You spent the first month interviewing candidates and have ranked each from 1 to 5 in the following areas:
* DS - Data science skills
* DE - Data engineering skills
* P - People skills
* BA - Business analysis skills
* L - Learning skills - ability to learn on their own using books, online videos, etc.
* KT - Knowlege transfer skills - ability to teach and transfer knowledge to other members of the data science team

Here is the short list of topc candidates, their rankings, and their requested salaries:

|Candidate|DS|DE|P|BA|L|KT|$|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bob|5|5|1|5|5|1|$165K|
|Alice|5|2|3|4|2|2|$170K|
|Mary|4|2|4|4|2|3|$145K|
|Jeff|4|4|4|4|4|4|$230K|
|Renee|1|5|5|5|5|5|$180K|
|Jonathan|4|3|2|3|1|2|$125K|
|Emily|3|2|3|5|1|1|$220K|
|Trevor|5|5|1|1|5|1|$119K|

As a group, go through each candidate and give a brief assessment.  

As a group, come up with the top 3 candidates you would like to make offers.

After you make the list, management comes back with some budget considerations.  They give you a budget of $450k to $500k for the hiring.  In light of the new budget constraints, come up with a new list of top 3 candidates.

For the revised list, discuss which skills the team would have gaps in and propose solutions to close those gaps.
