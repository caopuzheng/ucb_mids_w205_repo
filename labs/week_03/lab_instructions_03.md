# Instructions for Labs for Week 03

## Lab: Linux CLI - Connecting, Logging In, Users, Groups

Cleanup from prior runs (we will explain these command later):
```
cd /home/w205/user/labs/week_03

rm -rf temp_1

rm -f test.bash

cd

clear
```

Website that will graphically explain shell commands to you:

https://explainshell.com/

Man (manual) pages are old school way to get information about shell commands.  Note that it has a simple screen based browser.  Use the arrow keys, the enter key, the space bar, etc. to move around.  When you are done, hit a q to quit:
```
man hostname

man uname

man cat
```

If you google for Linux man pages, you will see lots of websites that have online Linux man pages that you can query and read.  This is usually much easier.

The Linux prompt shows you the: username, hostname (IP address in our case), and directory.

You can scroll back and forth through previous command history using the up and down arrows.  You can edit previous command.  You can hit enter anywhere in the edit and it will be sentd (don't have to be at the end of the line).

You can see the history with the history command:
```
history
```
When typing command in the Linux command line, the screen will scroll.  If you want to start with fresh screen, you can use clear:
```
clear
```
If the screen gets messed up, say you accidentally print a binary file, you can reset it:
```
reset
```
Get the hostname (for AWS, note is it the internal, not external name!):
```
hostname
```
Get the kernel name, kernel release version, and the machine type:
```
uname --kernel-name --kernel-release --machine
```
Get the Linux "distro" (distribution) information:
```
cat /etc/os-release
```
Get the username of the user currently logged in:
```
whoami
```
Get the username and id, primary group name and id, other groups:
```
id
```
Get the list of all users:
```
cat /etc/passwd
```
Get the list of all groups: 
```
cat /etc/group
```
The .ssh directory holds the authorized_keys file.  This file stores public keys.  Users are authenticated by possessing a private key matching the public key.  Public keys can be publicly posted.  Private keys must be kept private and closely guarded:
```
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Get the amount of disk space that is free:
```
df -h
```

## Lab: Linux CLI - Files, Directories, Ownership, Permissions

Show the current directory:
```
pwd
```
Change directory - cd by itself always takes you home:
```
cd   
```
cd to a relative path name (does not start with / aka root or ~ aka home):
```
cd docker
```
. means current directory:
```
cd ./clusters
```
.. means parent directory:
```
cd ../images
```
Absolute path name, starts with / aka root:
```
cd /home/w205/docker
```
absolute path name, starts with ~ aka home:
```
cd ~/docker/images
```
ls lists all the files and directories in the current directory:
```
cd

ls
```
ls -l lists in long format, more info:  
* type (d = directory, - = file, l = symbolic link)
* number of hard links
* user who owns the file
* group 
* size in bytes
* last updated date time
* name
```
ls -l

ls -l docker

ls -l ./docker

ls -l ./docker/.././docker

ls -l user/labs/week_06
```
Adding the -h will make it give files sizes in bytes, K, M, G, etc.:
```
ls -lh

ls -lh user/labs/week_06
```
Adding the -a will make it give hidden directories and hidden files (in Linux what makes a directory or file hidden is if the name starts with a .)
```
ls -lha

ls -lha user/labs/week_06
```
Permissions:
* r = read
* w = write
* x = execute (for files, it means execute as a program; for directories, it means cd to the directory)
* first set of rwx is for the user
* second set of rwx is for the group
* third set of rwx is for others (anyone who is not the user nor in the group)
* root is the super user that can read any file regardless of permissions
```
ls -lha ~/docker/mounts/postgres/

ls -lha ~/docker/mounts/postgres/data
```
When we want to use root privileges, we can logout and login as root (assuming we have the ssh key for root). As an alternative, we can be granted sudo privileges.  sudo = "super user (root) do".  We can put sudo in front of any command and run the command as root:
```
sudo ls -lha ~/docker/mounts/postgres/data
```
mkdir create a directory:
```
cd /home/w205/user/labs/week_03

mkdir temp_1

cd temp_1

mkdir temp_1_1

mkdir /home/w205/user/labs/week_03/temp_1/temp_1_2

mkdir temp_1_3

mkdir temp_1_4
```
Recursively list out a directory tree:
```
ls -lhR
```
cp copies a file:
```
cp /home/w205/user/labs/week_06/temp_holidays*.csv temp_1_1

cp /home/w205/user/labs/week_06/temp_products*.csv temp_1_2

cp /home/w205/user/labs/week_06/temp_customers*.csv temp_1_3
```
rm deletes a file:
```
cd temp_1_1

rm temp_holidays_2.csv

cd ..

rm temp_1_2/temp_products*header.csv
```
mv "moves" aka renames a file:
```
cd temp_1_1

mv temp_holidays.csv temp_holidays_old.csv
```
rmdir deletes a directory, but it must be empty:
```
cd ..

rmdir temp_1_4

rmdir temp_1_3
```
Recursive rm -r can delete directories that are not empty:
```
rm -r temp_1_3
```
Permissions default mask:
```
umask
```
Permissions octal numbers:
* r = read = 2^2 = 4
* w = write = 2^1 = 2
* x = execute = 2^0 = 1
* 1 = --x
* 2 = -w-
* 3 = -wx
* 4 = r--
* 5 = r-x
* 6 = rw-
* 7 = rwx

Change permissions on a file or directory using octal notation:
```
chmod 765 temp_1_1

cd temp_1_1

chmod 431 *.csv

cd ..

chmod -R 555 temp_1_1
```
Change permissions on a file or directory using UGO notation:
* u = user
* g = group
* o = other (warning: NOT owner!)
```
cd temp_1_1

chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r *

chmod u-r,g+w,o+w *

cd ..
```
Unlike most other OSs, Linux separates files from directory entries;  Linux files are noted by inode.
```
cd temp_1_2

ls -lhi
```
Hard links: multiple directory entries for same file; file is only actually deleted when the last hard link is deleted; hard links must be in the same file system:
```
ln temp_products_3.csv temp_products_4.csv

ls -lhi

cat temp_products_3.csv 

cat temp_products_4.csv

rm temp_products_3.csv

ls -lhi

rm temp_products_4.csv

ls -lhi
```
Symbolic links are just pointers from one directory to another or one file to another; symbolic links can go across file systems; deleting a symbolic link has no effect on the orginal file or directory:
```
cd ..

ln -s temp_1_2 temp_1_3

cd temp_1_2

ln -s temp_products.csv temp_prods.csv

rm temp_prods.csv
```

## Lab: Linux CLI - Commonly Used Commands

Reset permissions:
```
cd ~/user/labs/week_03

chmod 775 temp_1

chmod 775 temp_1/*

chmod 664 temp_1/temp_1_1/*.csv
```

Redirecting standard input, standout output, standard error:
* < redirects standard input
* \> redirects standard output and overwrites
* \>\> redirects standard output and appends, does not overwrite
* 2\> redirects standard error
```
cd temp_1/temp_1_1

wc -l <temp_holidays_old.csv

date

date >date.txt

cat date.txt

date >>date.txt

cat date.txt

date >>date.txt

cat date.txt

date >date.txt

cat date.txt

ls not_a_file

ls not_a_file 2>error.txt

cat error.txt
```
less is a utility to view a file; man pages that we used earlier uses less; the older utility was called more, so they say that "less is more":
```
seq 10000

seq 10000 >numbers.txt

less numbers.txt
```
head returns the first few lines of a file; optionally pass the number of lines to return:
```
head numbers.txt

head -100 numbers.txt

head temp_holidays_old.csv
```
tail returns the last few lines of a file; optionall pass the number of lines to return:
```
tail numbers.txt

tail -100 numbers.txt

tail temp_holidays_old.csv
```
grep matches a pattern in a file and returns lines that match the pattern:
```
grep 871 numbers.txt

grep er temp_holidays_old.csv
```
grep -v returns the opposite, the rows that do NOT match:
```
grep -v er temp_holidays_old.csv
```
| is a pipeline; Linux spawn a process for each command; Linux creates an "anonymous pipe" aka "un-named pipe" between the processes; Linux routes standard output to pipes and routes standard input from pipes for intermediate commands
```
grep 817 numbers.txt

grep 817 numbers.txt | wc -l 

grep 817 numbers.txt | grep -v 5

grep 817 numbers.txt | grep -v 5 | wc -l
```
Create a couple of  files of random numbers:
```
echo 5 >file_1.txt
echo 17 >>file_1.txt
echo 16 >>file_1.txt
echo 81 >>file_1.txt
echo 92 >>file_1.txt
echo 35 >>file_1.txt
echo 21 >>file_1.txt
echo 16 >>file_1.txt
echo 5 >>file_1.txt
echo 35 >>file_2.txt

cat file_1.txt

echo 5 >file_2.txt
echo 17 >>file_2.txt
echo 16 >>file_2.txt
echo 82 >>file_2.txt
echo 92 >>file_2.txt
echo 35 >>file_2.txt
echo 23 >>file_2.txt
echo 16 >>file_2.txt
echo 5 >>file_2.txt

cat file_2.txt
```
diff finds the differences between two files
```
diff file_1.txt file_2.txt

cp file_1.txt file_3.txt

diff file_1.txt file_3.txt
```
sort a file:
```
sort file_1.txt

sort -g file_1.txt

sort file_2.txt

sort -g file_2.txt
```
uniq removes duplicates from a file, however, the file MUST be sorted going into uniq:
```
uniq file_1.txt

sort -g file_1.txt | uniq

wc -l file_1.txt

sort -g file_1.txt | uniq | wc -l
```
uniq with -c option will count the number of duplicates, as before the file must be sorted going into uniq:
```
sort -g file_1.txt | uniq -c
```
gzip compresses a file using gnu zip; you will find it does much faster and smaller compression than zip:
```
gzip numbers.txt
```
Use the -d option to uncompress
```
gzip -d numbers.txt.gz
```
tar stand for tape archive; in the modern usage, it can create a single file that holds a directory tree similar to a zip file:
```
cd ~/user/labs/week_03

tar cvf temp.tar temp_1
```
To view the contents of a tar, use the tvf option:
```
tar tvf temp.tar
```
To extract a tar tile, use the xvf option:
```
rm -r temp_1

tar xvf temp.tar
```
We can also compress a tar using the cvfg which will use gzip to compress; some use the file extension .tar.gz, while others use .tgz:
```
tar cvfz temp.tar.gz temp_1

tar xvf temp.tar.gz

tar cvfz temp.tgz temp_1

tar xvf temp.tgz
```
find will walk a directory structure and find directories and files; it has a lot of options!:
```
find . -name *.csv
```
xargs will read a list of files from standard input and run the command that follows it on each file individually; commonly used with find and a pipe:
```
find . -name *.csv | wc -l

find . -name *.csv | xargs wc -l
```
file will tell you what type of file a file is:
```
file temp_1/temp_1_1/*

find ~/user/labs | xargs file
```
top shows the top processes in terms of CPU usage and memory usage; type a q to quit top:
```
top
```

## Lab: Linux CLI - vi Editor

Linux (and it's predecessor Unix) command line has a bad reputation for being very cryptic, unintuitive, un-user friendly, etc.  Frankly, much of that criticism is legitimate.  

Most would agree that the most difficult, cryptic, unituitive, un-user friendly part of Linux is the vi (or vim) editor.  A lot of Linux and Unix command line aversion probably comes from the vi editor.

vi works in a very strange way compared to modern editors such as notepad on Windows.    The reason that vi is so strange is for historical reasons.  In the 1970's when most computers were on punched cards, Unix had terminal with text based screens.  Computers at that time had very small CPU and memory.  vi was designed on top of the streams system in Unix, and more specifically, the streams editor, or sed.  The advantage of vi (and the sed engine underneath it) is that is can edit very large files with only a small piece of the file needing to be in memory.  

The first thing you notice about vi is that if you bring up a file for editing, you cannot type and have what you type show up.  As part of the way it saves memory, it has 3 modes:
* movement mode - the default mode vi will be in when you bring up a file; allows you to move around in the file, delete, copy, etc., but not type in new content
* insert mode - allows you to type in new content, but only in the current position;  if we want to insert in multiple locations, we have to keep switching to movement mode to move, insert mode to insert, movement mode to move, etc.
* command mode - allows you to type a sed command

Why is vi still in use?  Here are some possible reasons:
* Linux culture of wanting to keep things cryptic - somehow thinking that cryptic equals sophistication, rather than thinking user friendly equals sophistication
* We have always used vi
* vi is always available; other options may not be available
* Free alternatives to vi have cybersecurity issues
* Desktop alternatives are in wide spread use 

Linux alternatives: emacs, nano, pico, etc.  But these are not always available, probably because no one wants the liability for cybersecurity risks.

Desktop alternatives:  For example, on Windows, WinSCP is a GUI Windows application that allows you to use a directory and file browser, edit files locally on Windows, and have them automatically be transferred to and from Linux.  In addition to WinSCP, there are lots of commercial products.  These products tend to be costly.  Free desktop programs are all over the place, but beware of trojan horses.  A lot of these give you a free product, but they contain malware, or harvest your SSH keys (which they must access) and phone them home for later hacking.

Remote development environments: Even more powerful than desktop alternatives are remote development environments.  These environments not only allow you to remotely edit files, but also remotely execute code in a debugger.  For example, for Python, there is PyCharm.  You run the development environment on Windows, edit files in their IDE (integrated development environment) in Windows, and even remotely run your code in a debugger from Windows.

vi not a good solution for doing a lot of editing.  The purpose of this lab is just to teach you the basics of vi, so you can use it for small editing when you have to, such as when it's the only editor available.

Basic commands:
* vi filename
* Movement mode: arrow keys, page up, page down, 0 beginning of line, $ end of line, x delete character, dd delete line
* Movement mode to insert mode: i for insert, a for append, note that INSERT appears lower left
* Insert mode to movement mode: ESC key
* Movement mode to command mode: \: note that hitting the enter key will run the command and return to movement mode
* Save changes: \:w
* Save a file and exit: \:wq
* Quit: \:q
* Quit with unsaved changes: \:q!

## Lab: BASH Shell Commonly Used Features

Multiple shells are available in Linux:
* sh (Bourne Shell) - original shell from the 1970s developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs
* csh (C Shell) - Developed in the late 1970s by Bill Joy, a graduate student at Berkeley, similar to C programming language
* ksh (Korn Shell) - David Korn at Bell Labs
* bash (Bourne Again Shell) - most widely used modern shell, keeps a lot of the design of sh and extends it
* Others: tcsh (TC Shell), zsh (Z Shell)
* Python is also an alternative!

Since bash is the most widely used, we will use bash.

You will notice several hidden files in the home directory related to bash:
* .bash_history - a history of commands you have entered on the command line
* .bash_logout - run when you logout
* .bash_profile - run when you login
* .bashrc - run when you create a non-login shell;  it's a bit complicated to know when we generate a login shell versus a non-login shell, so we typically run .bashrc from .bash_profile and put most of our customizations there
```
cd

ls -la | grep bash

vi .bash_profile

vi .bashrc
```
When we type a command on the Linux command line, searches for the command in the path:
```
echo $PATH
```
Commands must have execute permission set.  Note that . (current directory) is not in the path.  This is for security reasons.  To run a command or script in the current directory, use ./script.bash

Alias's allow us to run command without using the path.
```
alias
```
We can find where a command or script is located; which uses the path; whereis searches for typical locations even if not in path:
```
which ls

which bash

whereis ls

whereis bash
```
We can set environment variables using the shell; variables are only set in the current shell unless we export them:
```
env

MY_VARIABLE=5

export MY_VARIABLE

echo $MY_VARIABLE

env | grep MY_VARIABLE
```
Create a small example bash script:
```
cd  ~/user/labs/week_03

vi test.bash

#!/usr/bin/bash

export TEST_VARIABLE=500
```
The first line #! is called "hash bang" or "shebang"; it tells Linux which shell to use to execute the script.  Note that in Linux terms, Python is considered a shell and requires this also.

To run the script, we could specifically call it from bash:
```
bash test.bash
```
We could run it by setting the executable permission and calling it by name; recall that the current directory is not in the path, so we have to use ./test.bash
```
chmod u+x test.bash

test.bash

./test.bash
```
Let's see if our variable is present in the environment:
```
echo $TEST_VARIABLE

env | grep TEST_VARIABLE
```
Running a script creates a new shell, runs the script, and then exists the shell;  our variable was set, but in another shell, not our shell; sourcing a script means to run a script in the current shell;  we can source with the word source or with . space:
```
source test.bash

echo $TEST_VARIABLE

env | grep TEST_VARIABLE

. ./test.bash

echo $TEST_VARIABLE

env | grep TEST_VARIABLE
```
Review the scripts in the scripts directory:
```
cd ~/scripts
```
crontab allows you to schedule commands or scripts or programs to run; one caveat, it does NOT run your .bash_profile nor .bashrc! the format is:
* minute, 0 to 59
* hour, 0 to 23
* day of month, 1 to 31
* month, 1 to 12
* day of week, 0 to 6, 0 = Sunday
* command


Special macros:
* @yearly command => 0 0 1 1 *
* @daily command => 0 0 * * *
* @hourly command => 0 * * * *
* @reboot command => runs when the VM is started, booted, rebooted


Examples:
* \* * * * * command => every minute
* 30 8 10 6 * command => 8:30am on June 10
* 0 11,16 * * * command => 11am and 4pm every day
* 0 10-14 * * * command => 10am, 11am, 12 noon, 1pm, 2pm every day
* 0 10-14 * * 1-5 command => 10am, 11am, 12 noon, 1pm, 2pm, Monday through Friday
* \*/10 * * * * command => every 10 minutes
```
crontab -l

crontab -e
```

## Lab: GitHub - Typical Workflow Example

Create a new private repository:

GitHub => upper right dropdown => Your repositories =>  upper right green button New 

* Repository name => ucb_mids_w205_project_test
* Choose Private 
* Check Add a README file
* Click green button Create repository

Copy an https URL for the repo to clone it by clicking on the green button dropdown Code => choose HTTPS => click the copy button

In the Linux command line:
```
cd ~/user/projects

git clone https_link_copied_above

cd repo_directory_name

git status

git branch project

git checkout project

vi my_file_1.txt

git add my_file_1.txt

git commit -m "initial add"

git push origin project

```

Now update the file, create another file, stage, commit, and push
```
vi my_file_1.txt

vi my_file_2.txt

git add my_file_1.txt

git add my_file_2.txt

git commit -m "updates"

git push origin project

```

Once you are done create a pull request in GitHub


## Lab: GitHub - Troubleshooting Common Repo Problems

One common repo problem is students cloning the repo down to their VM and then making changes to the repo in GitHub. 

Another common repo problem is students making changes to the main branch in addition to changes to the project branch.  

The video will walk through the problem these causes and how to fix them.
